Photopea is a powerful browser-based photo editor that closely mimics Photoshop's
interface and functionality. It's become increasingly popular among digital
artists and Roblox GFX creators as it offers many professional features without
requiring any software installation.

### Cost

Photopea is free to use with ads displayed in the sidebar, though a premium
subscription is available for around $40 per year to remove ads. The free
version has no feature restrictions and includes support for PSD files, making
it an excellent option for those who can't afford or don't want to commit to
Photoshop's subscription.

Even as a web app, it provides robust tools for layers, masks, adjustments, and
filters - nearly everything a GFX artist needs, though some users might
experience slight performance limitations compared to desktop software.
