Affinity Designer is a vector graphics editor for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
It's a powerful tool for creating logos, icons, and other vector graphics.
It's also great for designing your game's UI.

### Cost

Affinity Designer uses a one-time purchase model rather than a subscription. It
typically costs around Â£67.99 for a license, with occasional sales
bringing the price even lower. Once purchased, you own the software outright with
no recurring fees, and major version upgrades are usually discounted for existing users.
