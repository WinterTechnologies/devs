Photoshop is the industry standard software for photo editing, but can also be
used to create thumbnails, commissions, and promotional art. It's the most
powerful tool for editing and enhancing Roblox renders, though its pricing model
can be a barrier for some creators.

### Cost

Photoshop is available through Adobe's subscription-based Creative Cloud service.
The standard plan costs around £21.98 per month for just Photoshop, while
students can access all Creative Cloud apps, including Photoshop, for a
discounted rate of £16.24 per month.
