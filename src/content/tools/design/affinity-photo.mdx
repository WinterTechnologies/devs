Affinity Photo is a powerful professional photo editing software, positioned as
a direct competitor to Photoshop. It offers comparable features and capabilities
for photographers and designers, but with a different pricing model that many
find more attractive.

### Cost

Affinity Photo uses a one-time purchase model rather than a subscription. It
typically costs around Â£59.99 for a permanent license, with occasional sales
bringing the price even lower. Once purchased, you own the software outright with
no recurring fees, and major version upgrades are usually discounted for existing users.
