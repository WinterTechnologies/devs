Create a script inside of ServerScriptService and paste this code.

local Players = game:GetService("Players")

--// Functions
local function playerAdded(player: Player)
    -- Create a leaderstats folder
    local leaderstats = Instance.new("Folder")
    leaderstats.Name = "leaderstats"

    -- This value will be inserted into the leaderstats folder, and displayed in the leaderboard.
    -- Copy these lines of code and replace the "Name" and "Value" if you want to add more values.
    local cash = Instance.new("IntValue")
    cash.Name = "Cach"
    cash.Value = 20
    cash.Parent = leaderstats


    -- Parent the leaderstats folder to the player after the values have been added.
    leaderstats.Parent = player
end
